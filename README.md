# Chaos-LSTM

This project aims to learn and model chaotic systems using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, with a focus on the Lorenz system. The repository includes data generation, preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Install dependencies via:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## How to Run

To execute the full pipeline, use the `run_all.py` script:
```bash
python run_all.py
```
This script will:
- Generate Lorenz system data
- Preprocess the data
- Train both LSTM and RNN models
- Save trained models
- Visualize results

## Results

The following images illustrate the predictions made by the LSTM and RNN models.

## Model Details

### LSTM Model
The LSTM model is defined in `src/lstm_model.py` and is used to predict the chaotic behavior of the Lorenz system.

### RNN Model
The RNN model is defined in `src/rnn_model.py` and is also applied to model the chaotic behavior.
